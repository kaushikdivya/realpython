Assignment: Wax poetic 
Write a script poetry.py that will generate a poem based on randomly chosen words and a pre-determined structure. When you are done, you will be able to generate poetic masterpieces such as the following in mere milliseconds: 


A furry horse 

A furry horse curdles within the fragrant mango 
extravagantly, the horse slurps 
the mango meows beneath a balding extrovert 


All of the poems will have this same general structure, inspired by Clifford Pickover: 


{A/An} {adjective1} {noun1} 

{A/An} {adjective1} {noun1} {verb1} {preposition1} the {adjective2} {noun2} 
{adverb1}, the {noun1} {verb2} 
the {noun2} {verb3} {preposition2} a {adjective3} {noun3} 


Your script should include a function  makePoem()  that returns a multi-line string representing a complete poem. The main section of the code should simply printmakePoem()  to display a single poem.
